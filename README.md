#### Here is a little bit about me:

- ðŸŽ¥ Iâ€™m currently looking into NextJS
- âªŒ Connect with me via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-li-474bba215/
- ðŸŽ¶ Fun fact: I did not pass my Grade 8 chamber choir audition. My teacher told me that I am tone-deaf. One time when I was singing, my parents ran upstairs to where I was because they thought I was screaming and something bad happened. Now...decades later, can I sing well? That's debatable. Do I still sing? Yup because it's fun. Similar to coding, I may not be the best but I'm going to still keep going - because it's fun.
