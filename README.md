### Hello World 👋

<!-- **StephhyL/StephhyL** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🎥 I’m currently working on my next YouTube video - subscribe? hahaha 😅
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (well, starting Feb 6, 2022)
- ⪌ Connect with me via LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-li-474bba215/
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can watch Kdramas at 2x the speed and still be able to keep up with the subtitles. Dare I say... Kdramas are teaching me Korean?
